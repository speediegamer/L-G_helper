# Looking Glass Helper

This utility makes installation and setup of Looking Glass easy.. ..if you're on Gentoo Linux

If you are running Ubuntu, Manjaro, Fedora, PopOS or Linux Mint, use the original by @pavolelsig 

Original helper: https://github.com/pavolelsig/L-G_helper

Download Looking Glass from: https://looking-glass.hostfission.com/

Supported Linux distributions: Gentoo (and possibly other gentoo based distributions)

# How to use:
- Download the scripts, and unzip them.
- Then cd into the directory where the .sh scripts are located.
- Run sudo/doas chmod +x lg-gentoo-helper-systemd.sh or lg-gentoo-helper.sh if you use OpenRC
- Download the Looking Glass source from the link above and copy the .tar.gz to the same folder (I added automatic .tar.gz extraction)
- Run sudo/doas ./lg-gentoo-helper-systemd.sh or lg-gentoo-helper.sh if you use OpenRC
